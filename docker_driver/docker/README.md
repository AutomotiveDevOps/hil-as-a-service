## Building the docker image

We want more options than this
`docker build -t raas .`
`docker tag raas philzook58/raas`
`docker push philzook58/raas`

We want to push to dockerhub

Do we want to set versions in the requirmeents.txt?
Do we want to have different images with different built in libraries? No.


`docker pull philzook58/raas`
